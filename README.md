# Project Peril
This repository contains the source code for a short game idea I had in mind that is heavily inspired by Mario Party's 2 [Hexagon Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-sSlssOYtU)

## Project Goals
1. Best practices with merging code and documentation
2. Maintain the Trello board more consistency
3. Look into multiplayer networking with this game
